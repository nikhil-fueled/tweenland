html-project1
=============

To run the project, you will have to clone from the repository. Once that is done, you will require to have the 
following on your local machine:
1. Node.js
2. Bower.
3. Grunt.

Once you have these, goto the directory of your cloned files. 
Now, run the following commands via the terminal.
1. npm install -g grunt-cli
2. Bower install
3. grunt server


This will deploy the web-app on your local machine.
Also, remember that the main html file to be run is new.html
So, to run the file, you'd have to key in something like
http://yoururl.com/new.html
